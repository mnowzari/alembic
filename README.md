# Alembic

### Alembic is a Rust crate that lets you log once and send anywhere.

For example, you can send the same log message to `stdout` and a log file at the same time, with a single `log.debug()` function call!

Currently supported output sinks:

- `stdout`
- `stderr`
- Log file
  - Rotation policies (`hourly`, `daily`, `weekly` and `monthly`)

### Examples coming soon!
